## The goal of the Codam Student Council
The student council is here to make sure student voices are heard, and offer staff an insight into what is going on at Codam. We aim to keep the quality of education high, as well as to improve the overall student experience.

### Formal representation
The council meets with staff regularly and is a formal representation of the student’s interests on an executive level. Both staff and students want Codam to provide the best 
possible education tailored towards the needs of IT and tech sectors, and the council represents the students’ perspective in this. Every term we actively work on a few topics that we think will improve the quality of studies most, and staff in turn takes this work seriously. 

### Clear communication
The council collects student opinions through surveys and focus groups to best represent the whole of the community. The council's advice can be delivered on the council's own initiative, based on an issue brought forward by a student at Codam, or asked for by the staff specifically. All this helps keep staff in touch with students and their studies.

The council is also committed to promoting transparency, openness, and frank discussion within Codam. We believe it is important that all students feel that they can express their opinions, and that Codam’s decision-making should be explained as clearly as possible to them. As such, the council will also always represent students who wish to remain anonymous.

### Safeguarding Codam’s values
Making sure that a world-class coding education is available to everyone is part of Codam’s mission, and the student council shares this ambition. We are dedicated to making sure the school is an inclusive place to study, and offers equal opportunity to all its students regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, ethnic or cultural background, health, or any physical or mental conditions they may be living with.

## Rights and Duties

The Codam Student Council Rights and Duties document is an agreement between the Council and the staff, describing the fundamentals of our cooperation. The main rights of the council as specified in the document are the rights to initiative, consultation, and information. 

### Initiative
The council is able to make suggestions to Codam staff on any subject concerning Codam, to which staff will reply (with their reasoning) within three months.

### Consultation
The Codam staff will ask the student council for advice on matters that affect the continued existence of Codam and good course of affairs within Codam, specifically on matters that affect the students’ learning process. They agree to do so early enough such that the Council’s advice can effectively influence policy. The staff will get back to the council on how their advice has been taken into account as soon as possible. When the advice is not followed, a reasonable explanation will be provided and the Council will be able to have another discussion before the final decision is made.

### Information
Codam agrees to inform the council unsolicited as possible about the matters that the council reasonably needs to know to be able to perform its duties. The staff will supply the council with information on any regulations and policies as made by 42 Paris that the council reasonably needs to know about to perform its duties, for example concerning education/examinations/quality control/privacy. 

### Besides this, it is also specified that
- The Codam staff makes sure that the members of the council will not be disadvantaged within Codam because of their position in the council.
- The Codam staff will provide resources that the council will be able to use, including a budget for training and team building activities. 
- Students can form independent committees to give advice to the student council, either on their own initiative or when consulted by the council.
